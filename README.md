# Lithium Ion Batteries vs Solid State Batteries

Lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion) are rechargeable batteries that power many things from a cell phones to EVs. They work by moving lithium ions from a metal oxide cathode to a graphite anode through a liquid electrolyte. During discharge, lithium ions move from the anode toward the cathode, generating electric current. During charging, the ions reverse direction. Li-ion batteries are chosen due to their great energy density, reasonable weight, and extended cycle life, even though they can potentially be dangerous by overheating or burning if physically abused or charged inefficiently.

Solid-state batteries (SSBs) replace the liquid electrolyte with a solid electrolyte, which can be manufactured from ceramics, glass, or polymers. This replacement offers incredible safety and stability advantages. Without liquid combustible elements, SSBs will be less likely to ignite. They are also potentially denser in energy, faster charging, and longer-lived, but are currently more expensive and more difficult to mass produce because of material and manufacturing problems.

While both solid-state and lithium-ion batteries employ lithium ions migrating between electrodes, their greatest difference lies in the state of electrolyte employedâ€”liquid for Li-ion and solid for SSBs. This change radically affects performance, safety, and manufacturability. Li-ion batteries are the batteries used widely today, but SSBs are where the future of battery innovation lies with improved performance and safety if technical hurdles can be overcome.
